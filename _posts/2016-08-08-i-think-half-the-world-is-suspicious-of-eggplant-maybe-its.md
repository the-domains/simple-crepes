  I think half the world is suspicious of eggplant. Maybe it’s because this
  lovely vegetable is often abused to the point of mush or maybe it’s because it
  doesn’t always look the most appetizing when cooked. Whatever the reason, it’s
  a shame and I’ll let you in on a secret. Eggplant in crepes – that’s something
  worth trying. The mix of eggplant with the sweetness of red pepper and basil
  and the salty taste of feta cheese in this recipe = yum! The fresh basil is a
  must, for color and taste.

I think half the world is suspicious of eggplant. Maybe it's because this lovely vegetable is often abused to the point of mush or maybe it's because it doesn't always look the most appetizing when cooked. Whatever the reason, it's a shame and I'll let you in on a secret. Eggplant in crepes -- that's something worth trying. The mix of eggplant with the sweetness of red pepper and basil and the salty taste of feta cheese in this recipe = yum! The fresh basil is a must, for color and taste.

The yogurt sauce is simple and good. Promise!
