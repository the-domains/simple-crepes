### Eggplant, Red Pepper, Feta & Basil Crepes with Yogurt Sauce

Prep time: 15 mins

Cook time: 20 mins

Total time: 35 mins

Author: simplecreperecipe.com

Serves: 2

### Ingredients

For the Crepes:

* 2 eggs
* 2 cups milk
* 1 cup plain flour
* ¼ tsp salt
* 1 tablespoon butter (for cooking)

For the Filling:

* 1 small eggplant, diced into ¼" cubes
* ¼ red onion, diced
* 1 clove garlic, pressed
* ½ tablespoon olive oil
* ½ red pepper, chopped
* 50 grams (or 1.7 ounces) feta cheese
* 1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil

For the Sauce:

* ¾ cup yogurt
* 1 tablespoon tahini
* 1 tablespoon lime juice
* ½ tablespoon honey
* ½ teaspoon apple cider vinegar
* Pepper, to taste

### Instructions

For the Crepes:

Mixing

1. Lightly whisk the eggs first, then add the liquids and mix.
2. Slowly add flour while whisking to get rid of the lumps (use a blender if you want)
3. Cover and let batter rest in the fridge for a couple of hours or overnight (don't have to rest the batter, but it makes them better).

Cooking

1. Heat the pan to medium-high
2. Mix the settled flour a few whisks of the batter (or a single blender pulse).
3. Add a ¼ teaspoon of butter to the hot pan (should sizzle) and spread by turning pan or brushing
4. Pour or ladle ¼ cup of batter into the middle of the hot pan and immediately swirl the pan to evenly coat the entire bottom in a single motion
5. Cook for 30- 45 seconds on the first side until the top dries out and the bottom is golden lacy brown. Flip with a spatula and cook for an additional 15-30 seconds

For the Filling:

1. Brown the onion in a little oil in the pan.
2. Add garlic and eggplant, stir to mix and cover to cook for approx. 10 mins until the vegetables are soft. Add red pepper about halfway through.
3. Take off the heat and add crumbled feta and basil just before assembling the crepes.

For the Sauce:

1. Assemble all ingredients and stir to mix.
